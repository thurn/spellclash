/// [ObjectId] internally. Effects should function properly with any number of
/// provided objects. Each effect's documentation should describe the
/// characteristics of its expected object set and the operation it performs on
/// those objects.
///
/// Effect implementations should silently ignore [ObjectId]s which no longer
/// exist.
///
/// From the Comprehensive Rules:
///
/// > An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or
/// > ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves,
/// > it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects.
